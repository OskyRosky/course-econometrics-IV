# Econometrics IV

## Advanced Econometric Modeling and Applied Economic Analysis

This repository contains the academic material, structure, and learning scope of the Econometrics IV course. The course represents an advanced stage in econometric training, focusing on the construction, evaluation, and interpretation of linear and generalized econometric models applied to real economic data.

The course is designed to strengthen analytical reasoning, empirical modeling skills, and the practical use of econometric tools in professional and academic economic contexts.

⸻

## 1. Course Overview

Econometrics IV is a theoretical–practical course that deepens the study of econometric methods for cross-sectional economic data. The course builds on previous econometrics courses and focuses on linear regression models, generalized models, diagnostic analysis, model selection, and remedial techniques.

Special emphasis is placed on understanding model assumptions, interpreting results correctly, and applying econometric reasoning to real-world economic problems using statistical software.

⸻

## 2. Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students are expected to:

	•	Understand and apply linear and multiple regression models in economic analysis
	•	Correctly interpret econometric coefficients and goodness-of-fit measures
	•	Diagnose violations of econometric assumptions and apply corrective methods
	•	Select appropriate econometric models based on statistical and economic criteria
	•	Analyze qualitative and limited dependent variable models
	•	Apply econometric techniques using professional statistical software

⸻

## 3. Core Topics Covered

	•	Difference between correlation and regression
	•	Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation
	•	Interpretation of regression coefficients
	•	Coefficient of determination (R²)
	•	Hypothesis testing of regression parameters

Multiple Linear Regression

	•	Matrix algebra foundations for econometrics
	•	Multivariate regression analysis
	•	OLS and Maximum Likelihood estimation
	•	Interpretation of multiple regression coefficients
	•	Sum of squares decomposition
	•	Hypothesis testing in multiple regression models

Model Selection and Evaluation

	•	Estimation of alternative regression specifications
	•	Goodness-of-fit measures
	•	Information criteria for model selection
	•	Comparative evaluation of econometric models

⸻

## 4. Diagnostic Analysis and Model Assumptions

A significant portion of the course focuses on validating econometric models through diagnostics:

	•	Classical assumptions of regression models
	•	Consequences of assumption violations
	•	Diagnostic tests for:
	•	Normality
	•	Homoscedasticity
	•	Multicollinearity
	•	Residual behavior
	•	Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
	•	Practical discussion on whether all assumptions must strictly hold

⸻

## 5. Advanced and Specialized Models

The course extends beyond classical linear models and introduces:

Remedial Measures

	•	Transformations of variables
	•	Weighted least squares
	•	Ridge regression

Qualitative and Limited Dependent Variable Models

	•	Regression with qualitative independent variables
	•	Interpretation of dummy variables
	•	Interaction effects
	•	Binary response models:
	•	Logit regression
	•	Probit regression
	•	Interpretation of marginal effects

Additional Topics

	•	Introduction to regression trees
	•	Conceptual understanding of non-linear modeling strategies

⸻

## 6. Tools and Software Used

Throughout the course, students work with professional analytical tools, mainly:

	•	R for econometric modeling and statistical analysis
	•	Data analysis and visualization libraries
	•	Real economic datasets from national and international contexts

The emphasis is on developing reproducible, interpretable, and professional-grade econometric analysis.

⸻

## 7. Teaching Methodology

The course follows a flipped classroom approach:

	•	Theoretical concepts are studied independently outside class
	•	Class sessions focus on:
	•	Applied exercises
	•	Case studies
	•	Discussion of real economic problems
	•	Interpretation of empirical results

This methodology encourages active participation, critical thinking, and applied learning.

⸻

## 8. Practical Work and Evaluation

Students reinforce their learning through:

	•	Multiple individual case studies based on real economic data
	•	Guided econometric exercises using R
	•	A final applied research project combining theory and empirical analysis

The evaluation emphasizes analytical rigor, clarity of interpretation, and correct econometric reasoning rather than mechanical computation.

⸻

## 9. Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as:

	•	A structured reference for advanced econometric concepts
	•	Supporting material for applied economic modeling
	•	A guide for students and practitioners seeking to strengthen their econometric foundations
	•	A bridge between theoretical econometrics and real-world economic analysis

⸻

## 10. Intended Audience
